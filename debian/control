Description: disk encryption support - startup scripts
 Cryptsetup provides an interface for configuring encryption on block
 devices (such as /home or swap partitions), using the Linux kernel
 device mapper target dm-crypt. It features integrated Linux Unified Key
 Setup (LUKS) support.
 .
 Cryptsetup is backwards compatible with the on-disk format of cryptoloop,
 but also supports more secure formats. This package includes support for
 automatically configuring encrypted devices at boot time via the config
 file /etc/crypttab. Additional features are cryptoroot support through
 initramfs-tools and several supported ways to read a passphrase or key.
 .
 This package provides the cryptdisks_start and _stop wrappers, as well as
 luksformat.

Description: disk encryption support - command line tools
 Cryptsetup provides an interface for configuring encryption on block
 devices (such as /home or swap partitions), using the Linux kernel
 device mapper target dm-crypt. It features integrated Linux Unified Key
 Setup (LUKS) support.
 .
 This package provides the cryptsetup, integritysetup and veritysetup
 utilities.

Description: disk encryption support - experimental SSH token handler
 Cryptsetup provides an interface for configuring encryption on block
 devices (such as /home or swap partitions), using the Linux kernel
 device mapper target dm-crypt. It features integrated Linux Unified Key
 Setup (LUKS) support.
 .
 This package provides the cryptsetup-ssh(8) utility and an SSH token plugin
 which can be used to unlock LUKS2 devices using a remote keyfile hosted on a
 system accessible through SSH.  This is currently an *experimental* feature
 and mostly serves as a demonstration of the plugin interface API.

Description: disk encryption support - initramfs integration
 Cryptsetup provides an interface for configuring encryption on block
 devices (such as /home or swap partitions), using the Linux kernel
 device mapper target dm-crypt. It features integrated Linux Unified Key
 Setup (LUKS) support.
 .
 This package provides initramfs integration for cryptsetup.

Description: disk encryption support - suspend mode integration
 Cryptsetup provides an interface for configuring encryption on block
 devices (such as /home or swap partitions), using the Linux kernel
 device mapper target dm-crypt. It features integrated Linux Unified Key
 Setup (LUKS) support.
 .
 This package provides suspend mode integration for cryptsetup. It takes
 care of removing LUKS master key from memory before system suspend.
 .
 Please note that the suspend mode integration is limited to LUKS devices
 and requires systemd.  Moreover, this is an early implementation and may not
 be as mature as the other cryptsetup-* packages yet.

Description: transitional dummy package for cryptsetup
 This is a transitional dummy package to get upgrading systems to install the
 cryptsetup package. It can safely be removed once no other package depends on
 it.
